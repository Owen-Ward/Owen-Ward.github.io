		<h2>Bio</h2>

		<p>I am a PhD candidate and research assistant in the Department
		of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Toronto. My dissertation
		investigates how speakers of Spanish and speakers of Portuguese differ
		in their perception and production of English lexical stress. My aim with
		this project is to investigate the link between segments and phonological
		processes affecting the production of segments in the L1 with the acquisition
		of suprasegmental features in an L2.</p>
