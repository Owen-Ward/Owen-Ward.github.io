				<h1>Non-productive affixes</h1>
			</header>
			<p>An affix is any morpheme that we can attach to a word to change its meaning in some way and a morpheme is the smallest indivisible unit of meaning in a language. To tell you what I mean, take for example the word “cat”. The word “cat” cannot be divided into anything further, and thus we can say that word contains one morpheme. Its plural, “cats” is formed by adding -s to the end of “cat”. The “cat” part tells us the semantic meaning of the word and the -s tells us the grammatical information that the word is plural. -s is one of a handful of affixes, specifically suffixes as they go at the end of the word, that we have in English to indicate grammatical meanings. Another one is the -ed that we add to most verbs to form the past tense. This system of adding suffixes to words to indicate some sort of grammatical meaning is called <em>inflection</em>.</p>
			<p>English has a fairly poor number of grammatical inflections, but it is rich in <em>derivational</em> affixes. Take for example, the “un-“ prefix (a prefix being an affix appended to the start of a word), which can be added to the start of a great many words to form words with similar semantics but in the negative. If we combine “un-“ with the verb “do” we can make “undo”, which means “cancel or reverse the effects or results of (a previous action or measure)” (Apple Dictionary). These inflectional and derivation affixes are known as <em>productive</em> because they can be used to coin totally new words with meanings that are well understood from their use. However, as languages change, affixes which were once productive fall out of use as new ones are developed and they are left behind, <em>fossilized</em> being the common term in linguistics, in the lexicon.</p>
			<p>In the Middle English period there was a suffix, “-ard”, meaning “Someone who is in a specified condition” (as per Wiktionary) though nowadays there are no new words being derived with “-ard”. However, English still uses words which were coined during the period this affix was productive, with examples being “wizard” and “drunkard”. “Drunkard” is fairly obvious knowing the old meaning of “-ard”, but “wizard”? When terms are fossilized often the pronunciation tends to shift a little bit, obfuscating the origin of the source word. “Wizard” is in fact analogous to “wise” + “-ard”, or originally meaning “Someone who is wise”.</p>
			<p>Another affix that used to be productive in the history of English but is no longer is the suffix -le. This used to indicate an action done repeatedly or that the action was continuous. This is kind of affix is common cross-linguistically and is known as a <em>frequentative</em>. There are many words in English suffixed with -le which are transparently derived from other verbs, for example: crackle (crack), handle (hand), sniffle (sniff), suckle (suck), startle (start), among others. Initially, a word like “crackle” meant “to crack repeatedly or continuously”, for example, but over time many of these verbs’ meanings have shifted so that we no longer see them as being related to the verb they derive from. As happens when derivational morphology because non-productive, pronunciation of the source word and the derived word tends to shift over time so that they no longer sound alike. What verbs do you think “dazzle”, “dribble”, “gamble”, “grapple” and “sizzle”,  come from? If you said “daze”, “drib”, “game”, “grab” and “siss”, I would be very impressed. If you noticed that you have never heard the words “drib” and “siss” before, indeed my spellchecker keeps wanting to correct “siss”, then another common linguistic change is for the original term to fall out of use while the derived term survives, but more on that for another time.</p>
